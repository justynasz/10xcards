# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Product

**10xCards** — an AI-powered flashcard generator with spaced repetition. The core loop: user pastes text → AI generates question/answer card proposals → user accepts/edits/discards each → accepted cards enter a spaced-repetition study queue. See `context/foundation/prd.md` for full requirements.

The codebase is currently at the starter-template stage. The auth scaffold is complete; the flashcard generation, deck management, and spaced-repetition features are not yet implemented.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier
- `npm test` — run tests once (vitest)
- `npm run test:watch` — vitest in watch mode

Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged): ESLint on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, Prettier on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Architecture

**Astro 6 SSR** with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, shadcn/ui. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

All pages are server-rendered (`output: "server"`). API routes must export `const prerender = false`.

### Supabase client

`src/lib/supabase.ts` exports `createClient()` which **returns `null`** when `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` are missing. Every caller must guard against null before using the client.

### Env vars

Env vars are declared via Astro's typed `astro:env/server` schema (configured in `astro.config.mjs`), not `import.meta.env` or `process.env`. Import them as:

```ts
import { SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY } from "astro:env/server";
```

For local dev: copy `.env.example` to `.dev.vars` (Cloudflare workerd reads `.dev.vars`). For Node-only use, copy to `.env`.

### Request lifecycle

1. `src/middleware.ts` runs on every request — creates a Supabase client, resolves `user` from the session cookie, attaches it to `context.locals.user`. Routes in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth/signin`.
2. Pages access the resolved user via `Astro.locals.user` (typed in `src/env.d.ts` as `User | null`).
3. API routes create their own Supabase client via `createClient(context.request.headers, context.cookies)`.

### Auth

- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Auth errors are returned as URL query params: `?error=<encoded-message>`
- Protected routes are declared in the `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array in `src/middleware.ts`

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `./src/*`
- **Astro components** for static content/layout; **React components** only when interactivity is needed
- **Tailwind class merging**: always use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` — never concatenate class strings manually
- **shadcn/ui**: components in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" variant. Add with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`
- **API routes**: uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports; validate input with Zod
- **Hooks**: extract to `src/components/hooks/`
- **Module structure**: every module under `src/lib/` must contain `index.ts`, `types.ts`, and `__tests__/`
- **Services/helpers**: `src/lib/` or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic
- **Shared types**: `src/types.ts`
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` with `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_description.sql`. Always enable RLS with per-operation, per-role policies

### Missing config banner

`src/layouts/Layout.astro` renders error banners for missing env vars using `missingConfigs` from `src/lib/config-status.ts`. When adding new required env vars, register them there.

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as Cloudflare secrets via `npx wrangler secret put` or the dashboard.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint + build on every push/PR to `master`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as GitHub repository secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
